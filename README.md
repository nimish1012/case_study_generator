# case_study_generator
We've created a cool project that uses fancy language tech and a PubMed database to quickly make detailed case studies from big medical articles. With our tool, you can whip up interesting case studies in just a few seconds.

Just type in the info about a patient, and our tool turns it into a short case study. It shows what disease or symptoms the patient has and compares them to similar cases in research articles on PubMed. So, you get real case studies on the topic super fast!
