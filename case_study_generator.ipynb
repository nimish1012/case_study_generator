            "1. Pneumology and phthisiology (respiratory medicine) has undergone dynamic development in the last two decades. The main focus of pulmonology in the past was care for patients with tuberculosis and pneumonia. Since then, respiratory medicine evolved and the current focus is on chronic pulmonary diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchial asthma, interstitial lung diseases, but also on acute lung conditions (e.g., pneumonia, pleural diseases, respiratory failure), pneumooncology or highly specialized care for rare lung diseases (e.g., cystic fibrosis, rare interstitial diseases). Bronchology, interventional pneumology and pulmonary function testing are also important components of respiratory medicine. The importance of respiratory medicine was apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this article, we provide a brief overview of the most important news to the field of respiratory medicine in the year 2022, addressing the thematic areas of bronchology, cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, interstitial lung diseases, pleural diseases, pneumooncology, tuberculosis and non-tuberculous mycobacteria.\n",
            "2. The following case report aims to highlight the rarity of the case in question, in which there is left Chilaiditi syndrome in a patient with bronchial asthma. The patient is a 79-year-old woman who arrived in January 2023 at my facility for episodes of recurrent dyspnea, chest heaviness, wheezing, eructation, dysphagia, epigastric abdominal pain associated with frequent episodes of bronchitis. He performed simple spirometry which showed mixed mild-moderate ventilatory deficit with reduction of small airway volumes, reduced peak expiratory flow and negative broncho reversibility tests for asthma. At 3 months, the patient returned to my attention with a chest radiograph showing marked elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with deviation of the cardiac shadow to the right. He repeated the spirometry which resulted in a clear improvement compared to the previous control with an important variation of the peak respiratory flow during ICS/LABA, the objective finding previously found disappeared, this indicating the presence of an underlying bronchial asthma. The radiological picture was identified by me as Left Chilaiditi Syndrome, as the patient had gastrointestinal symptoms which accompanied the procession of respiratory symptoms. The diagnostic suspicion must be early in these pathologies and the proton pump inhibitors and new generation alginates with the presence of hyaluronic acid and melatonin must also be included in the treatment of the symptoms, which have an important action on gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) secondary to this herniation of the viscera into the thoracic cavity. The rarity is represented by the left localization of the diaphragmatic pathology.\n",
            "3. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a hypersensitivity reaction to\n",
            "4. \n",
            "5. » Metallosis is a rare but significant complication that can occur after total hip arthroplasty (THA) for a variety of reasons but most commonly in patients with metal-on-metal implants.» It is characterized by the visible staining, necrosis, and fibrosis of the periprosthetic soft tissues, along with the variable presence of aseptic cysts and solid soft tissue masses called pseudotumors secondary to the corrosion and deposition of metal debris.» Metallosis can present with a spectrum of complications ranging from pain and inflammation to more severe symptoms such as osteolysis, soft tissue damage, and pseudotumor formation.» Workup of metallosis includes a clinical evaluation of the patient's symptoms, imaging studies, serum metal-ion levels, and intraoperative visualization of the staining of tissues. Inflammatory markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein along with intraoperative frozen slice analysis may be useful in certain cases to rule out concurrent periprosthetic joint infection.» Management depends on the severity and extent of the condition; however, revision THA is often required to prevent rapid progression of bone loss and tissue necrosis.\n",
            "6. Orbital inflammatory pseudotumor (OIP) is a benign, non-specific inflammatory disorder that commonly occurs in middle-aged adults and is usually unilateral but can occur bilaterally. Its clinical manifestations have tremendous clinical heterogeneity and vary according to the site of infiltration and the degree of lesions, including orbital pain, swelling, diplopia, proptosis, restricted eye movement, and decreased visual acuity. Clinical features, Image characteristics and pathological examinations often need to be evaluated to confirm the diagnosis. Currently, there is no systematic research on the pathogenesis of OIP, which may be related to immunity or infection. The first-line treatment is glucocorticoids. Radiotherapy, immunosuppressants, and biologics can be considered for treatment-resistant, hormone-dependent, or intolerant patients. In this review, we aim to summarize and focus on new insights into OIP, including new diagnostic criteria, pathogenesis, and discoveries in new drugs and treatment strategies. In particular, we highlight the literature and find that T cell-mediated immune responses are closely related to the pathogenesis of OIP. Further exploration of the mechanism and signaling pathway of T cells in the immune process will help to identify their therapeutic targets and carry out targeted therapy to treat refractory OIP and reduce the side effects of traditional treatments.\n",
            "7. Baihezhijiegeng is a processed product of Platycodonis radix, and it's effective in the treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). However, the specific mechanism of action has not been reported in the literature.\n",
            "We attempted to evaluate the phytochemical composition and pharmaco-dynamics of Platycodon grandiflorum (PG) and BJ to clarify the mechanism behind the expectorant effect of BJ.\n",
            "We integrated the ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-linear trap quadrupole orbitrap velos mass spectrometry (UPLC-LTQ Orbitrap MS/MS) and the ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole-time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS) methods to identify the chemical constituents of PG and BJ. Moreover, correlation and multivariate statistical analyses were utilized to seek the candidate quality markers of PG and BJ. Analysis of effective herbal chemical components using UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS and retrieval of COPD disease targets from OMIM, TTD, GeneCard databases. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) and topology analyses were performed using the String database and Cytoscape 3.7.2 software; gene ontology (GO) functional enrichment analysis and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were performed using the Metescape platform on common targets. Moreover, we used molecular docking to predict the potential mechanism of quality markers for developing anti-COPD activity. Simultaneously, the model of COPD was established by exposing the animals to cigarette smoke combined with a tracheal drip injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Using the ELISA method, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting (WB) to determine tumor-necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)9 levels in serum and IL-4, IL-10, IFN-γ levels, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and MUC5AC expression in lung tissue of COPD rats to explore the therapeutic effects of PG and BJ on the COPD rat model.\n",
            "The chemical identification of JG and PG extracts using UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS and UPLC-LTQ Orbitrap MS/MS showed 71 compounds, including 47 saponins, 16 phenolic acids, four flavonoids, and four other components. The multivariate statistical analysis showed that seven quality markers were screened. Network pharmacology results showed a role in biological processes such as cellular response to hydrogen peroxide, positive regulation of pri-miRNA transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter, molecular functions such as oxidoreductase activity, acting on NAD(P)H, quinone or similar compound as acceptor, bile acid binding and other molecular functions. In COPD rats, histopathological findings depicted that BJ administration could effectively inhibit inflammatory cell infiltration and mucus hypersecretion, and improve the lung pathological status in rats with COPD. Moreover, BJ could significantly decrease TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)9 levels in the serum and interferon (IFN)-γ levels in lung tissues of rats with COPD (p < 0.01), and significantly increase IL-4 and IL-10 levels in their lung tissues (p < 0.01), suggesting its inhibition of the inflammatory response in vivo. Additionally, EGFR and MUC5AC were reduced in the lung tissues of rats with COPD and airway mucus hypersecretion in rats with COPD.\n",
            "This study revealed the material basis of PG and BJ for anti-COPD activity and discovered the quality markers of PG and BJ which could affect the anti-COPD activity. The therapeutic effects of BJ may be attributed to the regulation of the inflammatory mediators and mediation of the EGFR/MUC5AC pathway in rats with COPD.\n",
            "8. In veterinary medicine, airway management of cats under general anesthesia is performed with an endotracheal tube (ETT) or supraglottic airway device (SGAD). This study aims to describe the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to assess the velocities, pressures, and resistances of cats with ETT or SGAD.\n",
            "A geometrical reconstruction model of the device, trachea, and lobar bronchi was carried out from computed tomography (CT) scans that include the head, neck, and thorax. Twenty CT scans of cats under general anesthesia using ETT (\n",
            "Recirculatory flow and high velocities were found at the ETT's bevel and at the glottis level in the SGAD group. The pressure gradient (Δp) was more enhanced in the ETT cases compared with the SGAD cases, where the pressure change was drastic. In region A, the Δp was higher in the ETT group, while in regions B and C, it was higher in the SGAD group. The general resistance was not statistically significant between groups (\n",
            "Overall, the provided CT-based CFD analysis demonstrated regional changes in airway pressure and resistance between ETT and SGAD during anesthetic flow conditions. Correct selection of the airway device size is recommended to avoid upper airway obstruction or changes in flow parameters.\n",
            "9. The aim of the present study is to describe our novel surgical technique of hemicricoidectomy and reconstruction with modified rotational thyro-crico-tracheal anastomosis for the treatment of non-squamous cell subglottic tumours. The procedure has been defined as Type E crico-tracheal resection and anastomosis (CTRA) following the University of Brescia (C)TRA classification introduced elsewhere.\n",
            "A detailed anatomical step-by-step dissection was reproduced and illustrated on a cadaveric laryngo-tracheal specimen. Moreover, oncological and functional outcomes of the first 5 patients who underwent Type E CTRA at our Institution between October 2016 and September 2022 are described.\n",
            "Three patients underwent Type E CTRA for cricoid chondrosarcoma (CS) and 2 patients for subglottic adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC). No post-operative complication was reported. All patients maintained intact oral intake and an intelligible voice at discharge. All but one patient with obstructive sleep apnoea hypopnea syndrome and lung comorbidity were successfully decannulated before discharge. At the last follow-up (April 2023), one patient experienced local recurrence of CS that was still amenable to conservative treatment by transoral debulking, while the remaining patients were free of disease.\n",
            "With the proper indications, Type E CTRA is a feasible and effective conservative surgical technique for selected non-squamous cell subglottic tumours.\n",

            "Scopo del presente studio è quello di descrivere una nuova tecnica chirurgica di emicricoidectomia e ricostruzione mediante anastomosi rotazionale tiro-cricotracheale modificata per il trattamento di tumori sottoglottici non-squamocellulari. La procedura è stata denominata resezione-anastomosi crico-tracheale (CTRA) Tipo E, in base alla classificazione delle (C)TRA dell’Università degli Studi di Brescia, già descritta in precedenza altrove.\n",
            "Una dissezione dettagliata è stata eseguita e illustrata su un pezzo anatomico laringo-tracheale proveniente da cadavere. Inoltre, i risultati oncologici e funzionali dei primi 5 pazienti sottoposti a CTRA Tipo E presso la nostra Clinica nel periodo ottobre 2016 - settembre 2022 sono stati qui descritti.\n",
            "Tre pazienti sono stati sottoposti a CTRA Tipo E per condrosarcoma (CS) cricoideo e 2 per carcinoma adenoidocistico (ACC) sottoglottico. Non è stata riscontrata nessuna complicanza post-operatoria. Tutti i pazienti hanno mantenuto una normale alimentazione per bocca e una voce comprensibile già alla dimissione. Tutti i pazienti sono stati decannulati prima della dimissione, tranne una che presentava una sindrome delle apnee ipopnee ostruttive notturne e importanti comorbidità polmonari. Durante il follow-up (terminato nell’aprile 2023) solo una paziente ha evidenziato una recidiva locale di CS, trattata conservativamente mediante debulking per via transorale, mentre i restanti pazienti sono tuttora liberi da malattia.\n",
            "Rispettando le corrette indicazioni, la CTRA Tipo E si è dimostrata una tecnica chirurgica conservativa riproducibile ed efficace per il trattamento di selezionati tumori sottoglottici non-squamocellulari.\n",
            "10. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a severe, multifactorial, and frequently misdiagnosed disorder. The aim of this observational study was to compare the plasma and urine metabolomic profiles of PAH patients and healthy control subjects. Plasma and urine metabolomic profiles were analyzed using the GC-MS technique. Correlations between metabolite levels and clinical parameters among PAH patients, as well as the between-group differences, were evaluated. The linear discriminant analysis model, which allows for subject classification in terms of PAH with the highest possible precision, was developed and proposed. Plasma pyruvic acid, cholesterol, threonine, urine 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-3-hydroxypropanoic acid, butyric acid, 1,2-benzenediol, glucoheptonic acid, and 2-oxo-glutaric acid were found to build a relatively accurate classification model for PAH patients. The model reached an accuracy of 91% and significantly improved subject classification (OR = 119 [95% CI: 20.3-698.3],\n",
            "11. Geriatric patients constitute a growing portion of the general population, with particular increase in the prevalence of octogenarians. The incidence and prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) have been clearly shown to be associated with advancing age. The effect of advanced age in outcomes from endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) is unclear. We study the effect of advanced age, as an independent risk factor for mortality in octogenarian geriatric patients (OGPs) compared to non-octogenarian geriatric patients (NOGPs) undergoing EVAR.\n",
            "The 2011-2017 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) Procedure-Targeted Vascular database was queried for geriatric patients (>65 years) undergoing EVAR for symptomatic and asymptomatic indications. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed comparing outcomes between OGPs and NOGPs.\n",
            "Of the 10,490 geriatric patients who underwent EVAR, 7508 (71.6%) were NOGPs and 2982 (28.4%) were OGPs. Octogenarians were more often female (82.3% vs. 76.7%). In comparison to NOGPs, fewer OGPs were treated for AAA <5.5 cm (46.7% vs. 54.9%, p<0.001) and AAA < 5.0 cm (19.2% vs. 24.0%, p<0.001). Nearly 90% of male and over 80% of female NOGPs and OGPs treated for AAA <5.0cm were asymptomatic. OGPs had less dyspnea (15.3% vs. 17.3%, p=0.01), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (16.1% vs. 20.5%, p<0.001), diabetes (12.7% vs. 17.8%, p<0.001), and smoking (13.2% vs. 36.3%, p<0.001) compared to NOGPs. OGPs were found to have a greater length of stay (2 days vs. 1 day, p<0.001), as well as rate of mortality (3.4% vs. 1.7%, p<0.001). Both symptomatic and asymptomatic OGPs had a higher rate of mortality than their NOGP counterparts (symptomatic 16% vs 9.5%, p<0.001; asymptomatic 1.3% vs 0.5%, p<0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed OGPs to have increased overall associated risk of mortality compared to NOGPs (OR 1.88, CI 1.39-2.54, p<0.001), as well as in the symptomatic (OR 1.54, CI 1.06-2.23, p<0.001) and asymptomatic cohorts (OR 2.66, CI 1.59-4.45, p<0.001).\n",
            "OGPs accounted for over a quarter of geriatric patients undergoing EVAR. This elderly group was associated with an increased rate and risk of mortality compared to NOGPs, even when controlling for known risk factors for mortality. Given this increased risk of mortality in OGPs undergoing EVAR, elective treatment of AAAs in this advanced age group should be performed with caution, particularly in those with diameters in which the risk of rupture may not warrant repair.\n",
            "12. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease is a chronic, often progressive disease, which in most patients is caused by tobacco smoking. Our study focuses on differences in COPD-related outcomes between never-smokers, former smokers and current smokers.\n",
            "A nationwide, population-based cohort study utilizing Danish health registries. Clinical and socioeconomical variables including smoking status, comorbidities, and dyspnoea were obtained. Poisson and Cox Regression were used to calculate the impact of these clinical parameters on risk of moderate and severe exacerbations and mortality during 12 months of follow-up.\n",
            "49.826 patients ≥40 years of age, with a hospital diagnosis of COPD in 2008-2017, were identified (mean age 69.2 years, 52% females). 2,127 (4%) were never-smokers, 29,854 (60%) former smokers and 17,845 (36%) current smokers. Compared to former and current smokers, never-smokers reported a lower MRC score and had a milder COPD stage according to GOLD classification. During follow-up, never-smokers had a significant lower risk of severe exacerbations (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.78-0.97) and a lower rate of death (mortality ratio 0.75, 95% CI 0.70-0.81) compared to patients with a smoking history.\n",
            "Our nationwide study showed that COPD in never-smokers is characterized by a lower level of dyspnoea, milder lung function impairment and a lower risk of exacerbations and death. At the same time, we found active smokers to have the highest risk. These findings highlight the need for campaigns to prevent smoking and may help general practitioners as well as other health care professionals to motivate patients with COPD to stop smoking.\n",
            "13. Wearable devices that can mechanically conform to human skin are a necessity for reliable monitoring and decoding of biomechanical activities through skin. Most inorganic piezoelectrics, however, lack deformability and damage tolerance, impeding stable motion monitoring. Here, we present an air-permeable fabric-based ZnO nanogenerator with mechanical adaptivity to diverse deformations for wearable piezoelectric sensors, collecting biomechanical health data. We fabricate ZnO nanorods incorporated throughout the entire nylon fabric, with a strategically positioned neutral mechanical plane, for bending-sensitive electronics (2.59 μA mm). Its hierarchically interlocked geometry also permits sensitive tactile sensing (0.15 nA kPa\n",
            "14. Asthma occurs frequently as a comorbid condition in many patients presenting with common otolaryngology conditions, such as allergic rhinitis and chronic sinusitis with nasal polyps. The classic presentation of asthma includes symptoms of wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness but can include other symptoms such as cough. The diagnosis is made mainly through history, although pulmonary function testing, spirometry, fractional exhaled nitric oxide, and impulse oscillometry may also prove helpful.\n",
            "15. Morchella esculenta, commonly known as yellow morels, is an edible and medicinal mushroom popular worldwide for its unique flavor and culinary purposes. The traditional medical system effectively uses morels against infertility, fatigue, cancer, muscular pain, cough, and cold. The M. esculenta possesses many health-promoting nutritional components such as mono and polyunsaturated fatty acids, polyphenols, protein hydrolysates, vitamins, amino acids and minerals. The potential medicinal properties of morels is due to polysaccharides (galactomannan, chitin, β-glucans, and β-1,3-1,6-glucan) present that has high economic importance worldwide. Polysaccharides present possess a broad spectrum of biological activities such as anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, anti-diabetic, and antioxidant. However, the toxicity and clinical trials to prove its safety and efficacy for medicinal uses are yet to be evaluated. Moreover, the separation, purification, identification, and structural elucidation of active compounds responsible for the unique flavors and biological activities are still lacking in M. esculenta. The available information provides a new base for future perspectives. It highlights the need for further studies of this potent medicinal mushroom species as a source of beneficial therapeutic drugs and nutraceutical supplements.\n"

            "- Use 1. Pneumology and phthisiology (respiratory medicine) has undergone dynamic development in the last two decades. The main focus of pulmonology in the past was care for patients with tuberculosis and pneumonia. Since then, respiratory medicine evolved and the current focus is on chronic pulmonary diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchial asthma, interstitial lung diseases, but also on acute lung conditions (e.g., pneumonia, pleural diseases, respiratory failure), pneumooncology or highly specialized care for rare lung diseases (e.g., cystic fibrosis, rare interstitial diseases). Bronchology, interventional pneumology and pulmonary function testing are also important components of respiratory medicine. The importance of respiratory medicine was apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this article, we provide a brief overview of the most important news to the field of respiratory medicine in the year 2022, addressing the thematic areas of bronchology, cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, interstitial lung diseases, pleural diseases, pneumooncology, tuberculosis and non-tuberculous mycobacteria.\n",
            "2. The following case report aims to highlight the rarity of the case in question, in which there is left Chilaiditi syndrome in a patient with bronchial asthma. The patient is a 79-year-old woman who arrived in January 2023 at my facility for episodes of recurrent dyspnea, chest heaviness, wheezing, eructation, dysphagia, epigastric abdominal pain associated with frequent episodes of bronchitis. He performed simple spirometry which showed mixed mild-moderate ventilatory deficit with reduction of small airway volumes, reduced peak expiratory flow and negative broncho reversibility tests for asthma. At 3 months, the patient returned to my attention with a chest radiograph showing marked elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with deviation of the cardiac shadow to the right. He repeated the spirometry which resulted in a clear improvement compared to the previous control with an important variation of the peak respiratory flow during ICS/LABA, the objective finding previously found disappeared, this indicating the presence of an underlying bronchial asthma. The radiological picture was identified by me as Left Chilaiditi Syndrome, as the patient had gastrointestinal symptoms which accompanied the procession of respiratory symptoms. The diagnostic suspicion must be early in these pathologies and the proton pump inhibitors and new generation alginates with the presence of hyaluronic acid and melatonin must also be included in the treatment of the symptoms, which have an important action on gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) secondary to this herniation of the viscera into the thoracic cavity. The rarity is represented by the left localization of the diaphragmatic pathology.\n",

            "5. » Metallosis is a rare but significant complication that can occur after total hip arthroplasty (THA) for a variety of reasons but most commonly in patients with metal-on-metal implants.» It is characterized by the visible staining, necrosis, and fibrosis of the periprosthetic soft tissues, along with the variable presence of aseptic cysts and solid soft tissue masses called pseudotumors secondary to the corrosion and deposition of metal debris.» Metallosis can present with a spectrum of complications ranging from pain and inflammation to more severe symptoms such as osteolysis, soft tissue damage, and pseudotumor formation.» Workup of metallosis includes a clinical evaluation of the patient's symptoms, imaging studies, serum metal-ion levels, and intraoperative visualization of the staining of tissues. Inflammatory markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein along with intraoperative frozen slice analysis may be useful in certain cases to rule out concurrent periprosthetic joint infection.» Management depends on the severity and extent of the condition; however, revision THA is often required to prevent rapid progression of bone loss and tissue necrosis.\n",
            "6. Orbital inflammatory pseudotumor (OIP) is a benign, non-specific inflammatory disorder that commonly occurs in middle-aged adults and is usually unilateral but can occur bilaterally. Its clinical manifestations have tremendous clinical heterogeneity and vary according to the site of infiltration and the degree of lesions, including orbital pain, swelling, diplopia, proptosis, restricted eye movement, and decreased visual acuity. Clinical features, Image characteristics and pathological examinations often need to be evaluated to confirm the diagnosis. Currently, there is no systematic research on the pathogenesis of OIP, which may be related to immunity or infection. The first-line treatment is glucocorticoids. Radiotherapy, immunosuppressants, and biologics can be considered for treatment-resistant, hormone-dependent, or intolerant patients. In this review, we aim to summarize and focus on new insights into OIP, including new diagnostic criteria, pathogenesis, and discoveries in new drugs and treatment strategies. In particular, we highlight the literature and find that T cell-mediated immune responses are closely related to the pathogenesis of OIP. Further exploration of the mechanism and signaling pathway of T cells in the immune process will help to identify their therapeutic targets and carry out targeted therapy to treat refractory OIP and reduce the side effects of traditional treatments.\n",

            "We attempted to evaluate the phytochemical composition and pharmaco-dynamics of Platycodon grandiflorum (PG) and BJ to clarify the mechanism behind the expectorant effect of BJ.\n",
            "We integrated the ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-linear trap quadrupole orbitrap velos mass spectrometry (UPLC-LTQ Orbitrap MS/MS) and the ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole-time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS) methods to identify the chemical constituents of PG and BJ. Moreover, correlation and multivariate statistical analyses were utilized to seek the candidate quality markers of PG and BJ. Analysis of effective herbal chemical components using UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS and retrieval of COPD disease targets from OMIM, TTD, GeneCard databases. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) and topology analyses were performed using the String database and Cytoscape 3.7.2 software; gene ontology (GO) functional enrichment analysis and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were performed using the Metescape platform on common targets. Moreover, we used molecular docking to predict the potential mechanism of quality markers for developing anti-COPD activity. Simultaneously, the model of COPD was established by exposing the animals to cigarette smoke combined with a tracheal drip injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Using the ELISA method, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting (WB) to determine tumor-necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)9 levels in serum and IL-4, IL-10, IFN-γ levels, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and MUC5AC expression in lung tissue of COPD rats to explore the therapeutic effects of PG and BJ on the COPD rat model.\n",
            "The chemical identification of JG and PG extracts using UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS and UPLC-LTQ Orbitrap MS/MS showed 71 compounds, including 47 saponins, 16 phenolic acids, four flavonoids, and four other components. The multivariate statistical analysis showed that seven quality markers were screened. Network pharmacology results showed a role in biological processes such as cellular response to hydrogen peroxide, positive regulation of pri-miRNA transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter, molecular functions such as oxidoreductase activity, acting on NAD(P)H, quinone or similar compound as acceptor, bile acid binding and other molecular functions. In COPD rats, histopathological findings depicted that BJ administration could effectively inhibit inflammatory cell infiltration and mucus hypersecretion, and improve the lung pathological status in rats with COPD. Moreover, BJ could significantly decrease TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)9 levels in the serum and interferon (IFN)-γ levels in lung tissues of rats with COPD (p < 0.01), and significantly increase IL-4 and IL-10 levels in their lung tissues (p < 0.01), suggesting its inhibition of the inflammatory response in vivo. Additionally, EGFR and MUC5AC were reduced in the lung tissues of rats with COPD and airway mucus hypersecretion in rats with COPD.\n",
            "This study revealed the material basis of PG and BJ for anti-COPD activity and discovered the quality markers of PG and BJ which could affect the anti-COPD activity. The therapeutic effects of BJ may be attributed to the regulation of the inflammatory mediators and mediation of the EGFR/MUC5AC pathway in rats with COPD.\n",

This study aims to describe the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to assess the velocities, pressures, and resistances of cats with ETT or SGAD.\n",
            "A geometrical reconstruction model of the device, trachea, and lobar bronchi was carried out from computed tomography (CT) scans that include the head, neck, and thorax. Twenty CT scans of cats under general anesthesia using ETT (\n",
            "Recirculatory flow and high velocities were found at the ETT's bevel and at the glottis level in the SGAD group. The pressure gradient (Δp) was more enhanced in the ETT cases compared with the SGAD cases, where the pressure change was drastic. In region A, the Δp was higher in the ETT group, while in regions B and C, it was higher in the SGAD group. The general resistance was not statistically significant between groups (\n",
            "Overall, the provided CT-based CFD analysis demonstrated regional changes in airway pressure and resistance between ETT and SGAD during anesthetic flow conditions. Correct selection of the airway device size is recommended to avoid upper airway obstruction or changes in flow parameters.\n",

The aim of the present study is to describe our novel surgical technique of hemicricoidectomy and reconstruction with modified rotational thyro-crico-tracheal anastomosis for the treatment of non-squamous cell subglottic tumours. The procedure has been defined as Type E crico-tracheal resection and anastomosis (CTRA) following the University of Brescia (C)TRA classification introduced elsewhere.\n",
            "A detailed anatomical step-by-step dissection was reproduced and illustrated on a cadaveric laryngo-tracheal specimen. Moreover, oncological and functional outcomes of the first 5 patients who underwent Type E CTRA at our Institution between October 2016 and September 2022 are described.\n",
            "Three patients underwent Type E CTRA for cricoid chondrosarcoma (CS) and 2 patients for subglottic adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC). No post-operative complication was reported. All patients maintained intact oral intake and an intelligible voice at discharge. All but one patient with obstructive sleep apnoea hypopnea syndrome and lung comorbidity were successfully decannulated before discharge. At the last follow-up (April 2023), one patient experienced local recurrence of CS that was still amenable to conservative treatment by transoral debulking, while the remaining patients were free of disease.\n",

            "Scopo del presente studio è quello di descrivere una nuova tecnica chirurgica di emicricoidectomia e ricostruzione mediante anastomosi rotazionale tiro-cricotracheale modificata per il trattamento di tumori sottoglottici non-squamocellulari. La procedura è stata denominata resezione-anastomosi crico-tracheale (CTRA) Tipo E, in base alla classificazione delle (C)TRA dell’Università degli Studi di Brescia, già descritta in precedenza altrove.\n",
            "Una dissezione dettagliata è stata eseguita e illustrata su un pezzo anatomico laringo-tracheale proveniente da cadavere. Inoltre, i risultati oncologici e funzionali dei primi 5 pazienti sottoposti a CTRA Tipo E presso la nostra Clinica nel periodo ottobre 2016 - settembre 2022 sono stati qui descritti.\n",
            "Tre pazienti sono stati sottoposti a CTRA Tipo E per condrosarcoma (CS) cricoideo e 2 per carcinoma adenoidocistico (ACC) sottoglottico. Non è stata riscontrata nessuna complicanza post-operatoria. Tutti i pazienti hanno mantenuto una normale alimentazione per bocca e una voce comprensibile già alla dimissione. Tutti i pazienti sono stati decannulati prima della dimissione, tranne una che presentava una sindrome delle apnee ipopnee ostruttive notturne e importanti comorbidità polmonari. Durante il follow-up (terminato nell’aprile 2023) solo una paziente ha evidenziato una recidiva locale di CS, trattata conservativamente mediante debulking per via transorale, mentre i restanti pazienti sono tuttora liberi da malattia.\n",

            "10. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a severe, multifactorial, and frequently misdiagnosed disorder. The aim of this observational study was to compare the plasma and urine metabolomic profiles of PAH patients and healthy control subjects. Plasma and urine metabolomic profiles were analyzed using the GC-MS technique. Correlations between metabolite levels and clinical parameters among PAH patients, as well as the between-group differences, were evaluated. The linear discriminant analysis model, which allows for subject classification in terms of PAH with the highest possible precision, was developed and proposed. Plasma pyruvic acid, cholesterol, threonine, urine 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-3-hydroxypropanoic acid, butyric acid, 1,2-benzenediol, glucoheptonic acid, and 2-oxo-glutaric acid were found to build a relatively accurate classification model for PAH patients. The model reached an accuracy of 91% and significantly improved subject classification (OR = 119 [95% CI: 20.3-698.3],\n",
            "11. Geriatric patients constitute a growing portion of the general population, with particular increase in the prevalence of octogenarians. The incidence and prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) have been clearly shown to be associated with advancing age. The effect of advanced age in outcomes from endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) is unclear. We study the effect of advanced age, as an independent risk factor for mortality in octogenarian geriatric patients (OGPs) compared to non-octogenarian geriatric patients (NOGPs) undergoing EVAR.\n",
            "The 2011-2017 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) Procedure-Targeted Vascular database was queried for geriatric patients (>65 years) undergoing EVAR for symptomatic and asymptomatic indications. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed comparing outcomes between OGPs and NOGPs.\n",
            "Of the 10,490 geriatric patients who underwent EVAR, 7508 (71.6%) were NOGPs and 2982 (28.4%) were OGPs. Octogenarians were more often female (82.3% vs. 76.7%). In comparison to NOGPs, fewer OGPs were treated for AAA <5.5 cm (46.7% vs. 54.9%, p<0.001) and AAA < 5.0 cm (19.2% vs. 24.0%, p<0.001). Nearly 90% of male and over 80% of female NOGPs and OGPs treated for AAA <5.0cm were asymptomatic. OGPs had less dyspnea (15.3% vs. 17.3%, p=0.01), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (16.1% vs. 20.5%, p<0.001), diabetes (12.7% vs. 17.8%, p<0.001), and smoking (13.2% vs. 36.3%, p<0.001) compared to NOGPs. OGPs were found to have a greater length of stay (2 days vs. 1 day, p<0.001), as well as rate of mortality (3.4% vs. 1.7%, p<0.001). Both symptomatic and asymptomatic OGPs had a higher rate of mortality than their NOGP counterparts (symptomatic 16% vs 9.5%, p<0.001; asymptomatic 1.3% vs 0.5%, p<0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed OGPs to have increased overall associated risk of mortality compared to NOGPs (OR 1.88, CI 1.39-2.54, p<0.001), as well as in the symptomatic (OR 1.54, CI 1.06-2.23, p<0.001) and asymptomatic cohorts (OR 2.66, CI 1.59-4.45, p<0.001).\n",
            "OGPs accounted for over a quarter of geriatric patients undergoing EVAR. This elderly group was associated with an increased rate and risk of mortality compared to NOGPs, even when controlling for known risk factors for mortality. Given this increased risk of mortality in OGPs undergoing EVAR, elective treatment of AAAs in this advanced age group should be performed with caution, particularly in those with diameters in which the risk of rupture may not warrant repair.\n",
            "12. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease is a chronic, often progressive disease, which in most patients is caused by tobacco smoking. Our study focuses on differences in COPD-related outcomes between never-smokers, former smokers and current smokers.\n",
            "A nationwide, population-based cohort study utilizing Danish health registries. Clinical and socioeconomical variables including smoking status, comorbidities, and dyspnoea were obtained. Poisson and Cox Regression were used to calculate the impact of these clinical parameters on risk of moderate and severe exacerbations and mortality during 12 months of follow-up.\n",
            "49.826 patients ≥40 years of age, with a hospital diagnosis of COPD in 2008-2017, were identified (mean age 69.2 years, 52% females). 2,127 (4%) were never-smokers, 29,854 (60%) former smokers and 17,845 (36%) current smokers. Compared to former and current smokers, never-smokers reported a lower MRC score and had a milder COPD stage according to GOLD classification. During follow-up, never-smokers had a significant lower risk of severe exacerbations (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.78-0.97) and a lower rate of death (mortality ratio 0.75, 95% CI 0.70-0.81) compared to patients with a smoking history.\n",
            "Our nationwide study showed that COPD in never-smokers is characterized by a lower level of dyspnoea, milder lung function impairment and a lower risk of exacerbations and death. At the same time, we found active smokers to have the highest risk. These findings highlight the need for campaigns to prevent smoking and may help general practitioners as well as other health care professionals to motivate patients with COPD to stop smoking.\n",
            "13. Wearable devices that can mechanically conform to human skin are a necessity for reliable monitoring and decoding of biomechanical activities through skin. Most inorganic piezoelectrics, however, lack deformability and damage tolerance, impeding stable motion monitoring. Here, we present an air-permeable fabric-based ZnO nanogenerator with mechanical adaptivity to diverse deformations for wearable piezoelectric sensors, collecting biomechanical health data. We fabricate ZnO nanorods incorporated throughout the entire nylon fabric, with a strategically positioned neutral mechanical plane, for bending-sensitive electronics (2.59 μA mm). Its hierarchically interlocked geometry also permits sensitive tactile sensing (0.15 nA kPa\n",
            "14. Asthma occurs frequently as a comorbid condition in many patients presenting with common otolaryngology conditions, such as allergic rhinitis and chronic sinusitis with nasal polyps. The classic presentation of asthma includes symptoms of wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness but can include other symptoms such as cough. The diagnosis is made mainly through history, although pulmonary function testing, spirometry, fractional exhaled nitric oxide, and impulse oscillometry may also prove helpful.\n",
            "15. Morchella esculenta, commonly known as yellow morels, is an edible and medicinal mushroom popular worldwide for its unique flavor and culinary purposes. The traditional medical system effectively uses morels against infertility, fatigue, cancer, muscular pain, cough, and cold. The M. esculenta possesses many health-promoting nutritional components such as mono and polyunsaturated fatty acids, polyphenols, protein hydrolysates, vitamins, amino acids and minerals. The potential medicinal properties of morels is due to polysaccharides (galactomannan, chitin, β-glucans, and β-1,3-1,6-glucan) present that has high economic importance worldwide. Polysaccharides present possess a broad spectrum of biological activities such as anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, anti-diabetic, and antioxidant. However, the toxicity and clinical trials to prove its safety and efficacy for medicinal uses are yet to be evaluated. Moreover, the separation, purification, identification, and structural elucidation of active compounds responsible for the unique flavors and biological activities are still lacking in M. esculenta. The available information provides a new base for future perspectives. It highlights the need for further studies of this potent medicinal mushroom species as a source of beneficial therapeutic drugs and nutraceutical supplements., and relate them with the case.\n",

Since then, respiratory medicine evolved and the current focus is on chronic pulmonary diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchial asthma, interstitial lung diseases, but also on acute lung conditions (e.g., pneumonia, pleural diseases, respiratory failure), pneumooncology or highly specialized care for rare lung diseases (e.g., cystic fibrosis, rare interstitial diseases). Bronchology, interventional pneumology and pulmonary function testing are also important components of respiratory medicine. The importance of respiratory medicine was apparent during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this article, we provide a brief overview of the most important news to the field of respiratory medicine in the year 2022, addressing the thematic areas of bronchology, cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, interstitial lung diseases, pleural diseases, pneumooncology, tuberculosis and non-tuberculous mycobacteria.\n",
            "2. The following case report aims to highlight the rarity of the case in question, in which there is left Chilaiditi syndrome in a patient with bronchial asthma. The patient is a 79-year-old woman who arrived in January 2023 at my facility for episodes of recurrent dyspnea, chest heaviness, wheezing, eructation, dysphagia, epigastric abdominal pain associated with frequent episodes of bronchitis. He performed simple spirometry which showed mixed mild-moderate ventilatory deficit with reduction of small airway volumes, reduced peak expiratory flow and negative broncho reversibility tests for asthma. At 3 months, the patient returned to my attention with a chest radiograph showing marked elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with deviation of the cardiac shadow to the right. He repeated the spirometry which resulted in a clear improvement compared to the previous control with an important variation of the peak respiratory flow during ICS/LABA, the objective finding previously found disappeared, this indicating the presence of an underlying bronchial asthma. The radiological picture was identified by me as Left Chilaiditi Syndrome, as the patient had gastrointestinal symptoms which accompanied the procession of respiratory symptoms. The diagnostic suspicion must be early in these pathologies and the proton pump inhibitors and new generation alginates with the presence of hyaluronic acid and melatonin must also be included in the treatment of the symptoms, which have an important action on gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) secondary to this herniation of the viscera into the thoracic cavity. The rarity is represented by the left localization of the diaphragmatic pathology.\n",
            "3. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a hypersensitivity reaction to\n",
            "4. \n",
            "5. » Metallosis is a rare but significant complication that can occur after total hip arthroplasty (THA) for a variety of reasons but most commonly in patients with metal-on-metal implants.» It is characterized by the visible staining, necrosis, and fibrosis of the periprosthetic soft tissues, along with the variable presence of aseptic cysts and solid soft tissue masses called pseudotumors secondary to the corrosion and deposition of metal debris.» Metallosis can present with a spectrum of complications ranging from pain and inflammation to more severe symptoms such as osteolysis, soft tissue damage, and pseudotumor formation.» Workup of metallosis includes a clinical evaluation of the patient's symptoms, imaging studies, serum metal-ion levels, and intraoperative visualization of the staining of tissues. Inflammatory markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein along with intraoperative frozen slice analysis may be useful in certain cases to rule out concurrent periprosthetic joint infection.» Management depends on the severity and extent of the condition; however, revision THA is often required to prevent rapid progression of bone loss and tissue necrosis.\n",
            "6. Orbital inflammatory pseudotumor (OIP) is a benign, non-specific inflammatory disorder that commonly occurs in middle-aged adults and is usually unilateral but can occur bilaterally. Its clinical manifestations have tremendous clinical heterogeneity and vary according to the site of infiltration and the degree of lesions, including orbital pain, swelling, diplopia, proptosis, restricted eye movement, and decreased visual acuity. Clinical features, Image characteristics and pathological examinations often need to be evaluated to confirm the diagnosis. Currently, there is no systematic research on the pathogenesis of OIP, which may be related to immunity or infection. The first-line treatment is glucocorticoids. Radiotherapy, immunosuppressants, and biologics can be considered for treatment-resistant, hormone-dependent, or intolerant patients. In this review, we aim to summarize and focus on new insights into OIP, including new diagnostic criteria, pathogenesis, and discoveries in new drugs and treatment strategies. In particular, we highlight the literature and find that T cell-mediated immune responses are closely related to the pathogenesis of OIP. Further exploration of the mechanism and signaling pathway of T cells in the immune process will help to identify their therapeutic targets and carry out targeted therapy to treat refractory OIP and reduce the side effects of traditional treatments.\n",
            "7. Baihezhijiegeng is a processed product of Platycodonis radix, and it's effective in the treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). However, the specific mechanism of action has not been reported in the literature.\n",
            "We attempted to evaluate the phytochemical composition and pharmaco-dynamics of Platycodon grandiflorum (PG) and BJ to clarify the mechanism behind the expectorant effect of BJ.\n",
            "We integrated the ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-linear trap quadrupole orbitrap velos mass spectrometry (UPLC-LTQ Orbitrap MS/MS) and the ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole-time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS) methods to identify the chemical constituents of PG and BJ. Moreover, correlation and multivariate statistical analyses were utilized to seek the candidate quality markers of PG and BJ. Analysis of effective herbal chemical components using UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS and retrieval of COPD disease targets from OMIM, TTD, GeneCard databases. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) and topology analyses were performed using the String database and Cytoscape 3.7.2 software; gene ontology (GO) functional enrichment analysis and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were performed using the Metescape platform on common targets. Moreover, we used molecular docking to predict the potential mechanism of quality markers for developing anti-COPD activity. Simultaneously, the model of COPD was established by exposing the animals to cigarette smoke combined with a tracheal drip injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Using the ELISA method, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting (WB) to determine tumor-necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)9 levels in serum and IL-4, IL-10, IFN-γ levels, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and MUC5AC expression in lung tissue of COPD rats to explore the therapeutic effects of PG and BJ on the COPD rat model.\n",
            "The chemical identification of JG and PG extracts using UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS and UPLC-LTQ Orbitrap MS/MS showed 71 compounds, including 47 saponins, 16 phenolic acids, four flavonoids, and four other components. The multivariate statistical analysis showed that seven quality markers were screened. Network pharmacology results showed a role in biological processes such as cellular response to hydrogen peroxide, positive regulation of pri-miRNA transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter, molecular functions such as oxidoreductase activity, acting on NAD(P)H, quinone or similar compound as acceptor, bile acid binding and other molecular functions. In COPD rats, histopathological findings depicted that BJ administration could effectively inhibit inflammatory cell infiltration and mucus hypersecretion, and improve the lung pathological status in rats with COPD. Moreover, BJ could significantly decrease TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)9 levels in the serum and interferon (IFN)-γ levels in lung tissues of rats with COPD (p < 0.01), and significantly increase IL-4 and IL-10 levels in their lung tissues (p < 0.01), suggesting its inhibition of the inflammatory response in vivo. Additionally, EGFR and MUC5AC were reduced in the lung tissues of rats with COPD and airway mucus hypersecretion in rats with COPD.\n",
            "This study revealed the material basis of PG and BJ for anti-COPD activity and discovered the quality markers of PG and BJ which could affect the anti-COPD activity. The therapeutic effects of BJ may be attributed to the regulation of the inflammatory mediators and mediation of the EGFR/MUC5AC pathway in rats with COPD.\n",
            "8. In veterinary medicine, airway management of cats under general anesthesia is performed with an endotracheal tube (ETT) or supraglottic airway device (SGAD). This study aims to describe the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to assess the velocities, pressures, and resistances of cats with ETT or SGAD.\n",
            "A geometrical reconstruction model of the device, trachea, and lobar bronchi was carried out from computed tomography (CT) scans that include the head, neck, and thorax. Twenty CT scans of cats under general anesthesia using ETT (\n",
            "Recirculatory flow and high velocities were found at the ETT's bevel and at the glottis level in the SGAD group. The pressure gradient (Δp) was more enhanced in the ETT cases compared with the SGAD cases, where the pressure change was drastic. In region A, the Δp was higher in the ETT group, while in regions B and C, it was higher in the SGAD group. The general resistance was not statistically significant between groups (\n",
            "Overall, the provided CT-based CFD analysis demonstrated regional changes in airway pressure and resistance between ETT and SGAD during anesthetic flow conditions. Correct selection of the airway device size is recommended to avoid upper airway obstruction or changes in flow parameters.\n",
            "9. The aim of the present study is to describe our novel surgical technique of hemicricoidectomy and reconstruction with modified rotational thyro-crico-tracheal anastomosis for the treatment of non-squamous cell subglottic tumours. The procedure has been defined as Type E crico-tracheal resection and anastomosis (CTRA) following the University of Brescia (C)TRA classification introduced elsewhere.\n",
            "A detailed anatomical step-by-step dissection was reproduced and illustrated on a cadaveric laryngo-tracheal specimen. Moreover, oncological and functional outcomes of the first 5 patients who underwent Type E CTRA at our Institution between October 2016 and September 2022 are described.\n",
            "Three patients underwent Type E CTRA for cricoid chondrosarcoma (CS) and 2 patients for subglottic adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC). No post-operative complication was reported. All patients maintained intact oral intake and an intelligible voice at discharge. All but one patient with obstructive sleep apnoea hypopnea syndrome and lung comorbidity were successfully decannulated before discharge. At the last follow-up (April 2023), one patient experienced local recurrence of CS that was still amenable to conservative treatment by transoral debulking, while the remaining patients were free of disease.\n",
            "With the proper indications, Type E CTRA is a feasible and effective conservative surgical technique for selected non-squamous cell subglottic tumours.\n",

            "Scopo del presente studio è quello di descrivere una nuova tecnica chirurgica di emicricoidectomia e ricostruzione mediante anastomosi rotazionale tiro-cricotracheale modificata per il trattamento di tumori sottoglottici non-squamocellulari. La procedura è stata denominata resezione-anastomosi crico-tracheale (CTRA) Tipo E, in base alla classificazione delle (C)TRA dell’Università degli Studi di Brescia, già descritta in precedenza altrove.\n",
            "Una dissezione dettagliata è stata eseguita e illustrata su un pezzo anatomico laringo-tracheale proveniente da cadavere. Inoltre, i risultati oncologici e funzionali dei primi 5 pazienti sottoposti a CTRA Tipo E presso la nostra Clinica nel periodo ottobre 2016 - settembre 2022 sono stati qui descritti.\n",
            "Tre pazienti sono stati sottoposti a CTRA Tipo E per condrosarcoma (CS) cricoideo e 2 per carcinoma adenoidocistico (ACC) sottoglottico. Non è stata riscontrata nessuna complicanza post-operatoria. Tutti i pazienti hanno mantenuto una normale alimentazione per bocca e una voce comprensibile già alla dimissione. Tutti i pazienti sono stati decannulati prima della dimissione, tranne una che presentava una sindrome delle apnee ipopnee ostruttive notturne e importanti comorbidità polmonari. Durante il follow-up (terminato nell’aprile 2023) solo una paziente ha evidenziato una recidiva locale di CS, trattata conservativamente mediante debulking per via transorale, mentre i restanti pazienti sono tuttora liberi da malattia.\n",
            "Rispettando le corrette indicazioni, la CTRA Tipo E si è dimostrata una tecnica chirurgica conservativa riproducibile ed efficace per il trattamento di selezionati tumori sottoglottici non-squamocellulari.\n",
            "10. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a severe, multifactorial, and frequently misdiagnosed disorder. The aim of this observational study was to compare the plasma and urine metabolomic profiles of PAH patients and healthy control subjects. Plasma and urine metabolomic profiles were analyzed using the GC-MS technique. Correlations between metabolite levels and clinical parameters among PAH patients, as well as the between-group differences, were evaluated. The linear discriminant analysis model, which allows for subject classification in terms of PAH with the highest possible precision, was developed and proposed. Plasma pyruvic acid, cholesterol, threonine, urine 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-3-hydroxypropanoic acid, butyric acid, 1,2-benzenediol, glucoheptonic acid, and 2-oxo-glutaric acid were found to build a relatively accurate classification model for PAH patients. The model reached an accuracy of 91% and significantly improved subject classification (OR = 119 [95% CI: 20.3-698.3],\n",
            "11. Geriatric patients constitute a growing portion of the general population, with particular increase in the prevalence of octogenarians. The incidence and prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) have been clearly shown to be associated with advancing age. The effect of advanced age in outcomes from endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) is unclear. We study the effect of advanced age, as an independent risk factor for mortality in octogenarian geriatric patients (OGPs) compared to non-octogenarian geriatric patients (NOGPs) undergoing EVAR.\n",
            "The 2011-2017 American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) Procedure-Targeted Vascular database was queried for geriatric patients (>65 years) undergoing EVAR for symptomatic and asymptomatic indications. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed comparing outcomes between OGPs and NOGPs.\n",
            "Of the 10,490 geriatric patients who underwent EVAR, 7508 (71.6%) were NOGPs and 2982 (28.4%) were OGPs. Octogenarians were more often female (82.3% vs. 76.7%). In comparison to NOGPs, fewer OGPs were treated for AAA <5.5 cm (46.7% vs. 54.9%, p<0.001) and AAA < 5.0 cm (19.2% vs. 24.0%, p<0.001). Nearly 90% of male and over 80% of female NOGPs and OGPs treated for AAA <5.0cm were asymptomatic. OGPs had less dyspnea (15.3% vs. 17.3%, p=0.01), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (16.1% vs. 20.5%, p<0.001), diabetes (12.7% vs. 17.8%, p<0.001), and smoking (13.2% vs. 36.3%, p<0.001) compared to NOGPs. OGPs were found to have a greater length of stay (2 days vs. 1 day, p<0.001), as well as rate of mortality (3.4% vs. 1.7%, p<0.001). Both symptomatic and asymptomatic OGPs had a higher rate of mortality than their NOGP counterparts (symptomatic 16% vs 9.5%, p<0.001; asymptomatic 1.3% vs 0.5%, p<0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed OGPs to have increased overall associated risk of mortality compared to NOGPs (OR 1.88, CI 1.39-2.54, p<0.001), as well as in the symptomatic (OR 1.54, CI 1.06-2.23, p<0.001) and asymptomatic cohorts (OR 2.66, CI 1.59-4.45, p<0.001).\n",
            "OGPs accounted for over a quarter of geriatric patients undergoing EVAR. This elderly group was associated with an increased rate and risk of mortality compared to NOGPs, even when controlling for known risk factors for mortality. Given this increased risk of mortality in OGPs undergoing EVAR, elective treatment of AAAs in this advanced age group should be performed with caution, particularly in those with diameters in which the risk of rupture may not warrant repair.\n",
            "12. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease is a chronic, often progressive disease, which in most patients is caused by tobacco smoking. Our study focuses on differences in COPD-related outcomes between never-smokers, former smokers and current smokers.\n",
            "A nationwide, population-based cohort study utilizing Danish health registries. Clinical and socioeconomical variables including smoking status, comorbidities, and dyspnoea were obtained. Poisson and Cox Regression were used to calculate the impact of these clinical parameters on risk of moderate and severe exacerbations and mortality during 12 months of follow-up.\n",
            "49.826 patients ≥40 years of age, with a hospital diagnosis of COPD in 2008-2017, were identified (mean age 69.2 years, 52% females). 2,127 (4%) were never-smokers, 29,854 (60%) former smokers and 17,845 (36%) current smokers. Compared to former and current smokers, never-smokers reported a lower MRC score and had a milder COPD stage according to GOLD classification. During follow-up, never-smokers had a significant lower risk of severe exacerbations (HR 0.87, 95% CI 0.78-0.97) and a lower rate of death (mortality ratio 0.75, 95% CI 0.70-0.81) compared to patients with a smoking history.\n",
            "Our nationwide study showed that COPD in never-smokers is characterized by a lower level of dyspnoea, milder lung function impairment and a lower risk of exacerbations and death. At the same time, we found active smokers to have the highest risk. These findings highlight the need for campaigns to prevent smoking and may help general practitioners as well as other health care professionals to motivate patients with COPD to stop smoking.\n",
            "13. Wearable devices that can mechanically conform to human skin are a necessity for reliable monitoring and decoding of biomechanical activities through skin. Most inorganic piezoelectrics, however, lack deformability and damage tolerance, impeding stable motion monitoring. Here, we present an air-permeable fabric-based ZnO nanogenerator with mechanical adaptivity to diverse deformations for wearable piezoelectric sensors, collecting biomechanical health data. We fabricate ZnO nanorods incorporated throughout the entire nylon fabric, with a strategically positioned neutral mechanical plane, for bending-sensitive electronics (2.59 μA mm). Its hierarchically interlocked geometry also permits sensitive tactile sensing (0.15 nA kPa\n",
            "14. Asthma occurs frequently as a comorbid condition in many patients presenting with common otolaryngology conditions, such as allergic rhinitis and chronic sinusitis with nasal polyps. The classic presentation of asthma includes symptoms of wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness but can include other symptoms such as cough. The diagnosis is made mainly through history, although pulmonary function testing, spirometry, fractional exhaled nitric oxide, and impulse oscillometry may also prove helpful.\n",
            "15. Morchella esculenta, commonly known as yellow morels, is an edible and medicinal mushroom popular worldwide for its unique flavor and culinary purposes. The traditional medical system effectively uses morels against infertility, fatigue, cancer, muscular pain, cough, and cold. The M. esculenta possesses many health-promoting nutritional components such as mono and polyunsaturated fatty acids, polyphenols, protein hydrolysates, vitamins, amino acids and minerals. The potential medicinal properties of morels is due to polysaccharides (galactomannan, chitin, β-glucans, and β-1,3-1,6-glucan) present that has high economic importance worldwide. Polysaccharides present possess a broad spectrum of biological activities such as anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, anti-diabetic, and antioxidant. However, the toxicity and clinical trials to prove its safety and efficacy for medicinal uses are yet to be evaluated. Moreover, the separation, purification, identification, and structural elucidation of active compounds responsible for the unique flavors and biological activities are still lacking in M. esculenta. The available information provides a new base for future perspectives. It highlights the need for further studies of this potent medicinal mushroom species as a source of beneficial therapeutic drugs and nutraceutical supplements., Also add corresponding reference number from 1.

            "The objective of reporting this case is to highlight the importance of considering inflammatory pseudotumour as a rare entity in the differential diagnosis of respiratory distress, especially in patients presenting with symptoms of dyspnoea and cough. In this case, the patient initially presented with symptoms that were diagnosed as asthma bronchiale. However, further investigation revealed the presence of an inflammatory pseudotumour causing tracheal obstruction, which was the underlying cause of the patient's severe dyspnoea and cough. The case is noteworthy because inflammatory pseudotumour is a rare condition that is not commonly considered in the differential diagnosis of respiratory distress. The limitation in this approach is that it is based on a single case report, and further studies are needed to validate the findings and establish definitive diagnostic criteria for inflammatory pseudotumour.\n",

Most of the existing research focuses on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung diseases, and other common respiratory conditions. Therefore, this case report adds to the existing literature by highlighting the importance of considering inflammatory pseudotumour in the differential diagnosis of respiratory distress.

            "The symptoms of dyspnoea and cough are common in various respiratory conditions, including asthma bronchiale, tracheal obstruction, and inflammatory pseudotumour. Dyspnoea refers to a subjective sensation of difficult or labored breathing, while cough is a reflex action that helps to clear the airways from irritants or foreign substances. In asthma bronchiale, dyspnoea and cough are characteristic symptoms caused by bronchial inflammation and constriction. Tracheal obstruction can also lead to severe dyspnoea and cough, as it restricts the flow of air through the trachea. Inflammatory pseudotumour, although rare, can cause similar symptoms due to the presence of a mass or tumour in the respiratory tract.\n",

            "\n",
            "KEYWORDS – Asthma bronchiale, Inflammatory pseudotumour, Tracheal obstruction, Dyspnoea, Cough\n",
            "\n",
            "ABSTRACT –\n",
            "This case report highlights the importance of considering Inflammatory pseudotumour as a rare entity in the differential diagnosis of respiratory distress, presenting with symptoms of dyspnoea and cough initially diagnosed as asthma bronchiale. Tracheal obstruction can also cause severe dyspnoea and cough. \n",
            "\n",
            "The patient was discharged on the 7th post-operative day with a normal pulmonary function test and chest radiography, and no pulmonary symptoms. The extirpation of the lesion led to the subsidence of pulmonary symptoms. The prognosis for this condition is generally excellent, and recurrence is rare. The patient has completed her first year following surgery without any clinical symptoms.\n",
            "\n",
            "This case report adds to the scientific literature by emphasizing the importance of considering Inflammatory pseudotumour in the differential diagnosis of respiratory distress, especially in cases initially diagnosed as asthma bronchiale. It highlights the need for thorough evaluation and consideration of rare entities to ensure accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.\n",
            "\n",
            "One take-away lesson from this case report is the importance of considering rare entities in the differential diagnosis, even when a common diagnosis like asthma bronchiale seems likely. Another lesson is the significance of complete extirpation of the lesion in achieving excellent prognosis and resolution of symptoms.\n",
            "\n",
            "INTRODUCTION –\n",
            "Asthma bronchiale is a chronic respiratory condition characterized by dyspnoea and cough. It is commonly diagnosed based on symptoms and confirmed through pulmonary function testing. However, in this case study, the patient initially presented with dyspnoea and cough, which were initially diagnosed as asthma bronchiale. However, further investigation revealed an uncommon condition called inflammatory pseudotumour. This rare entity should be included in the differential diagnosis of respiratory distress.\n",
            "\n",
            "Inflammatory pseudotumour is a benign inflammatory disorder that can affect various organs, including the lungs. It can cause tracheal obstruction, leading to severe dyspnoea and cough. Complete extirpation of the lesion typically results in the resolution of pulmonary symptoms, and the prognosis is generally excellent, with recurrence being quite rare.\n",
            "\n",
            "Tracheal obstruction refers to the narrowing or blockage of the trachea, which can cause significant breathing difficulties. It can be caused by various factors, including inflammatory pseudotumour.\n",
            "\n",
            "Dyspnoea is the medical term for shortness of breath, while cough is a common symptom of respiratory conditions, including asthma bronchiale and inflammatory pseudotumour.\n",
            "\n",
            "In summary, this case study highlights the importance of considering inflammatory pseudotumour as a potential cause of respiratory distress. Tracheal obstruction can lead to dyspnoea and cough, which were initially misdiagnosed as asthma bronchiale in this patient. Early recognition and appropriate management of these conditions are crucial for optimal patient outcomes.\n",
            "\n",
            "CASE PRESENTATION –\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "The patient, a 33-year-old female with no prior chest symptomatology, presented to the hospital with a persistent cough, dyspnoea, and chest pain for the past 3.5 months. She had a history of obesity and a left femoral fracture, which was treated with splinting and traction 20 years ago. Despite receiving non-specific antibiotics and bronchodilating treatment, her symptoms did not improve.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "Upon examination, the patient had wheezing and chest tightness. Auscultation revealed the presence of stridor sounds throughout the respiratory system. The patient's medical history revealed that she had been admitted to the emergency department when her symptoms first developed, where paracardiac infiltration was detected on chest radiography and wheezing was heard on auscultation. Subsequent treatment with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting 2-agonists did not alleviate her symptoms.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "Diagnostic assessments were conducted, including imaging studies such as chest radiography and consultation with specialists. The chest radiography showed regression of the infiltrations, but the patient's cough and chest tightness persisted and progressed. Upon consultation, it was discovered that the patient had an inflammatory pseudotumour, a rare entity that can cause respiratory distress. Tracheal obstruction was identified as a potential cause of her severe dyspnoea and cough.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "The patient underwent a tracheotomy and surgical extirpation of the inflammatory pseudotumour. The histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis. The patient was discharged on the 7th post-operative day with normal pulmonary function and chest radiography, and no pulmonary symptoms. The prognosis is generally excellent, with rare recurrence. The patient was prescribed discharge medications and an assessment plan was outlined.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "The patient has completed one year following surgery without any clinical symptoms. Follow-up evaluations have shown normal pulmonary function and chest radiography. The treatment was effective in relieving the patient's symptoms, and no adverse events were reported. The patient did not require a return to the hospital, indicating a successful outcome.\n",
            "\n",
            "DISCUSSION:\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "The objective of reporting this case is to highlight the importance of considering inflammatory pseudotumour as a rare entity in the differential diagnosis of respiratory distress, especially in patients presenting with symptoms of dyspnoea and cough. In this case, the patient initially presented with symptoms that were diagnosed as asthma bronchiale. However, further investigation revealed the presence of an inflammatory pseudotumour causing tracheal obstruction, which was the underlying cause of the patient's severe dyspnoea and cough. The case is noteworthy because inflammatory pseudotumour is a rare condition that is not commonly considered in the differential diagnosis of respiratory distress. The limitation in this approach is that it is based on a single case report, and further studies are needed to validate the findings and establish definitive diagnostic criteria for inflammatory pseudotumour.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "In the field of respiratory medicine, there has been significant development in the understanding and management of chronic pulmonary diseases, including asthma bronchiale. However, the literature review reveals that there is limited information available on the diagnosis and management of inflammatory pseudotumour, which is a rare condition. Most of the existing research focuses on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial lung diseases, and other common respiratory conditions. Therefore, this case report adds to the existing literature by highlighting the importance of considering inflammatory pseudotumour in the differential diagnosis of respiratory distress. It also emphasizes the need for further research and studies to improve the understanding and management of this rare condition.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "The symptoms of dyspnoea and cough are common in various respiratory conditions, including asthma bronchiale, tracheal obstruction, and inflammatory pseudotumour. Dyspnoea refers to a subjective sensation of difficult or labored breathing, while cough is a reflex action that helps to clear the airways from irritants or foreign substances. In asthma bronchiale, dyspnoea and cough are characteristic symptoms caused by bronchial inflammation and constriction. Tracheal obstruction can also lead to severe dyspnoea and cough, as it restricts the flow of air through the trachea. Inflammatory pseudotumour, although rare, can cause similar symptoms due to the presence of a mass or tumour in the respiratory tract.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "This case report highlights the rarity of inflammatory pseudotumour as a cause of respiratory distress and the importance of considering it in the differential diagnosis. Inflammatory pseudotumour is a rare entity that can present with symptoms similar to asthma bronchiale, tracheal obstruction, and other respiratory conditions. The case also demonstrates the successful management of the condition through tracheotomy and surgical extirpation of the tumour. The prognosis for inflammatory pseudotumour is generally excellent, with rare recurrence. This case report contributes to the medical field by raising awareness about the existence of inflammatory pseudotumour and emphasizing the need for further research and studies to improve the understanding and management of this rare condition.\n",
            "\n",
            "CONCLUSION:\n",
            "\n",
            "In conclusion, this case report highlights the importance of considering inflammatory pseudotumour in the differential diagnosis of respiratory distress. The symptoms of dyspnoea and cough, which are commonly associated with asthma bronchiale, can also be caused by inflammatory pseudotumour and tracheal obstruction. This case report adds to the existing literature by emphasizing the rarity of inflammatory pseudotumour and the need for further research and studies to improve the understanding and management of this condition. The successful management of the patient through tracheotomy and surgical extirpation of the tumour demonstrates the positive prognosis and potential for effective treatment. Overall, this case report contributes to the medical field by raising awareness about the existence of inflammatory pseudotumour and providing insights into its diagnosis and management. Further research and studies are needed to validate the findings and establish definitive diagnostic criteria and treatment guidelines for inflammatory pseudotumour.\n",
